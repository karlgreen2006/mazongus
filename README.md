# mazongus
This is an Unreal Engine game I developed sometime ago. As the game files are too large for me to post here on GitHub, here's the link to the game's page on itch.io:

To summarise this project, it's an incomplete game where a person gets dragged into their phone after playing a cursed version of Among Us. From there, the player gets chased around the maze by the imposter, but in the form of a demon.

It does sound a bit dumb, and it is but I'm posting it here anyway as it helps to show the progress I've made with learning programming and game development.
